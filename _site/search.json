    "text": "Why this blog ?\nAs I continue learning and exploring software engineering, and other fields I deeply interested (philosophy, politics, literature,…) - I’ve realized the value of sharing knowledge. Here, I’ll break down technical concepts in software engineering, from programming languages to building apps, into practical and easy-to-understand pieces.\nSharing what I learn makes the whole process more meaningful. Writing about it not only helps me understand things better but also gives others a chance to benefit from it. If something here catches your interest or helps you out, that’s what makes this blog worthwhile for me."
