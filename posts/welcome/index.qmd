In today’s digital age , there is so much information available on every subject, whether you’re looking to learning new skill or dive deeper into a particular  field , it's all on internet. Growing up in this era has significantly shaped my own journey. Much of what I know today, particularly in the field of software engineering, has come from online resources.

## Why this blog ?

As I continue learning and exploring software engineering, and other fields I deeply interested (philosophy, politics, literature,...) - I’ve realized the value of sharing knowledge. Here, I’ll break down technical concepts in software engineering, from programming languages to building apps, into practical and easy-to-understand pieces.

Sharing what I learn makes the whole process more meaningful. Writing about it not only helps me understand things better but also gives others a chance to benefit from it. If something here catches your interest or helps you out, that’s what makes this blog worthwhile for me.
